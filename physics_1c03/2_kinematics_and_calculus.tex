    starting with $v= \frac{dx}{dt}$
    \begin{equation*}
        v= \frac{dx}{dt} \Rightarrow \int v dt = \int \frac{dx}{dt} dt = \int dx = x_f-x_i + x_0
    \end{equation*}
    The integration constant is $x_0$ \\
    The following relation is how position, velocity and acceleration can be
    found.
    \begin{align*}
        x \xRightarrow{\frac{d}{dt}}&\ v \xRightarrow{\frac{d}{dt}} a \\
        x \xLeftarrow[\int dt]{}&\ v \xLeftarrow[\int dt]{} a
    \end{align*}

    \section*{Motion with non-constant acceleration}
    to find the change in velocity during the time interval $\Delta t$, we can find the area under the $a_x(t)$ curbe

    \section*{Motion with constant acceleration}
    When acceleration is constant, the velocity and position formulas can be simplified
    \begin{align*}
        v(t) &= v_0 + \int_0^t a(t') dt' \\
             &= v_0 + a\int_0^t dt' \\
             &= v_0 + at \\
        x(t) &= x_0 + \int_0^t v(t') dt' \\
             &= x_0 + \int_0^t v_0 + at' dt' \\
             &= x_0 + \int_0^t v_0 dt' + \int_0^t at' dt' \\
             &= x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2} at^2
    \end{align*}
\end{document}
