    \maketitle
    Newton's method is a method of finding roots for a equation. It works by
    finding where a tangent line to a function intercepts with the x axis, then
    repeating for the tangent line at the x value where the previous tangent
    intercepts the x axis. If evaluated at an initial guess, Newton's method
    will refine the guess, making it closer and closer to the actual root of a
    equation.

    Let $x_1$ be an initial guess and $x_2$ be the x coordinate where the
    tangent line at $x_1$ intercepts the y-axis.

    \begin{align*}
        y-f(x_1) = f'(x_1)(x-x_1) \\
        0-f(x_1) = f'(x_1)(x_2-x_1) \\
        -f(x_1) = f'(x_1)x_2-f'(x_1)x_1 \\
        f'(x_1)x_1 - f(x_1) = f'(x_1)x_2 \\
        \frac{f'(x_1)x_1 - f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = x_2 \\
        x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} = x_2 \\
        x_2=x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)}
    \end{align*}

    Thus the formula for refining guesses is
    \begin{align*}
        x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
    \end{align*}
\end{document}
