    \maketitle
    A absolute maximum is the maximum value that a function can produce. The
    absolute minimum is the minimum value that a function can produce. A local
    maximum is a point where any direction in the input space will produce a
    lesser value and likewise for local minimum. A point can be both a absolute
    maximum and local maximum. If function is undefined to the left or right of
    a point (blue graph at $(0,1)$), then it cannot be an local max or min.

    \begin{tikzpicture}
         \begin{axis}
             \addplot [
                domain=-1:0,
                samples=70,
                color=blue,
                ]
                {-x^2+1.2};
             \addplot [
                domain=0:1,
                samples=70,
                color=red,
                ]
                {(x-1)^2};
             \addplot [
                domain=-1:0,
                samples=70,
                color=red,
                ]
                {(x+1)^2+1};
         \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}

    If a function has a "max", but it is on a open interval and thus not part of
    the graph, then it is not considered a max.

    \subsection*{Extreme Value Theorem}
    If f is continuous on a closed interval [a,b], the then f attains an
    absolute maximum value f(c) and an absolute minimum value f(d) at some
    numbers c and d in [a,b].

    \subsection*{Fermat's Theorem}
    If $f$ has a local maximum or minimum at $c$, and $f'(c)$ exists, then
    $f'(c)=0$. Note that if the derivative is zero, that does not necessary
    mean that a local extreme exists. Local extreme values can also happen when
    $f(c)\ne 0$. When the derivative $f'(c)$ is zero or does not exists, then
    $c$ is considered a critical number.

    \subsection*{Finding Maximum and Minimum}
    The absolute maximum and minimum of a continuous function on the closed
    interval $[a,b]$ can be found by following these steps:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the values of f at the critical numbers of f in (a,b)
        \item Find the values of f at the endpoints of the interval
        \item The largest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute
            maximum and the least of the values is the absolute minimum on the
            interval [a,b]
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection*{Example}
    \begin{align*}
        f(x)  &= 2\cos x + \sin 2x \\
        f'(x) &= -2\sin x + 2\cos2x \\
        0 &= -\sin x + \cos 2x \\
        0 &= -\sin x + \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x \\
        0 &= -\sin x + 1 - \sin^2 x - \sin^2 x \\
        0 &= -2\sin^2 x -\sin x + 1 \\
        \sin x &= \frac{-1 \pm 3}{4} \\
        \sin x &= -1, \frac{1}{2} \\
        x &= \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{5\pi}{6}
    \end{align*}
