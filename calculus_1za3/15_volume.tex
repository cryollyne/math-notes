\begin{document}
    \maketitle
    The volume of a function rotated around the x-axis is given by:
    \begin{align*}
        &\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \pi f(x_i)^2\Delta x \\
        &=\int_{a}^{b} \pi f(x)^2 \ dx
    \end{align*}

    The volume of a function rotated around the y-axis is equivalent to rotating
    around the x-axis, using the inverse function. The volume is given by:
    \begin{align*}
        &\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \pi f^{-1}(x_i)^2\Delta x \\
        &=\int_{a}^{b} \pi f^{-1}(x)^2 \ dx
    \end{align*}

    When finding the volume of a region bounded by two by $f$ and $g$:
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{a}^{b} \pi f(x)^2 \ dx - \int_{a}^{b} \pi g(x)^2 \ dx
    \end{align*}

    For rotating around any arbitrary horizontal line located at $y_0$:
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{a}^{b} \pi (f(x)-y_0)^2 - \pi (g(x)-y_0)^2 \ dx
    \end{align*}
\end{document}
