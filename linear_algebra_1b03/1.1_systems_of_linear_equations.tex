    \section*{Linear equations}
    a linear equation in \textit{n} unknowns or variables has the form:
    \begin{equation*}
        a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...+a_nx_n=b
    \end{equation*}

    Generally, 2 unknowns and 2 equations have one common solution, \textit{but} they could have none:
    \begin{align*}
        x_1+3x_2=2\\
        x_1+3x_2=3
    \end{align*}

    You could also have infinite solutions
    \begin{align*}
        x_1+3x_2=2\\
        2x_1+6x_2=4
    \end{align*}

    A finite set of linear equations is called a system of linear equations.
    \begin{align*}
        a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+...+a_{1n}x_n=b_1\\
        a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+...+a_{2n}x_n=b_2\\
        ...\\
        a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+...+a_{mn}x_n=b_m
    \end{align*}

    a augmented matrix is
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            a_{11} & a_{12} & ... & a_{1n} & b_1\\
            a_{21} & a_{22} & ... & a_{2n} & b_2\\
            ... &  & ... & & \\
            a_{m1} & a_{m2} & ... & a_{mn} & b_m\\
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation*}

    a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is a $m\times n$ matrix

    \subsection*{Examples}
    Linear:
    \begin{equation*}
        2x_1+3x_2=4
    \end{equation*}
    Non-linear:
    \begin{equation*}
        x_1^2+x_2^2=1
    \end{equation*}
