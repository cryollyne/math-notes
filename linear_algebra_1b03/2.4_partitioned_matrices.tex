\begin{document}
    \maketitle
    A is a $(m_1+m_2)\times (n_1+n_2)$ matrix where $A_{11}$ is a $m_1\times
    n_1$ matrix and $A_{21}$ is a $m_2\times n_1$ matrix.
    \begin{align*}
        A = \begin{bmatrix}
            A_{11} & A_{12} \\
            A_{21} & A_{22}
        \end{bmatrix} &&
        B = \begin{bmatrix}
            B_1 \\
            B_2
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    $B_1$ should be $n_1\times k$ and $B_2$ should be $n_2\times k$. The result
    will be a $(m_1 + m_2)\times k$ matrix.

    \begin{align*}
        AB = \begin{bmatrix}
            A_{11}B_1 + A_{12}B_2 \\
            A_{21}B_1 + A_{22}B_2
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}

    Important note: the order of the multiplications cannot be switched because
    the elements of the matrix are themselves matrices.

    \section*{Example}
    \begin{align*}
        A = \begin{bmatrix}
            A_{11} & A_{12} \\
            0      & A_{22}
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    If $A_{11}$ and $A_{22}$ are invertible and $A_{12}$ is any arbitrary
    matrix, then prove that $A$ is invertible.
